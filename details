Functionality:
1)The sidebar is movable that is by clicking the Three-line(Home-section) we can toggle the sidebar inside-out.

2)Inside the sidebar there are three dropdown menu's present which works only when the down/upward arrows are clicked.

3)The search feature has been added with the functionality of seperating the data by its category or Alphabetical order and can be used by clicking the arrow present inside the table's header(eg. Beside brands,description etc);

4)I tried to copy the the layout provided by you in the given time of 2 days 
Thanks for your patience.

5)Will be a pleasure to get a feedback from your side.
Regards.
